	* Possible uses for Reverb Zones include: a covered area with no walls, a forested area within an outdoor space, or any situation where multiple reverb effects are desired within a common space.
	* Reverb Zones have many advantages compared to standard Game-Defined Auxiliary Sends (i.e. compared to the AkLateReverbComponent or the AkReverbVolume). They are part of the wet path, and form reverb chains with other Rooms;
	* they are spatialized according to their 3D extent; they are also subject to other acoustic phenomena simulated in Wwise Spatial Audio, such as diffraction and transmission.

	* @param InParentRoom - The parent Room component. A parent Room can have multiple Reverb Zones, but a Reverb Zone can only have a single Parent. If a Room is already assigned to a parent Room, it is first removed from the old parent (exactly as if RemoveReverbZone were called) before then being assigned to the new parent Room. A Reverb Zone can be the parent of another Reverb Zone. A Room cannot be its own parent. Defaults to the 'Outdoors' Room if left empty.
